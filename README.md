================

This makes it easier to open and run the latest version of Burp Suite via terminal or command line.

I personally prefer to replace the Burp Suite bash loader in Kali & Backtrack with this.
I also use it in Windows to load Burp Suite by using a btach file to give it more memory and to run the latest version after each upgrade without editing the batch file.
